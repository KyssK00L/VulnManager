# VulnManager Backend Code Review

## Critical Issues Identified

1. **Missing dependency in the token validation endpoint**  
   The `HEAD /api/tokens/validate` route is supposed to verify the API token via the `verify_api_token` dependency, as mentioned in its docstring comment. However, the dependency was never injected, so the endpoint always responded with `204 No Content` even when no Authorization header was supplied. This effectively disabled token validation for the Word macro client. The fix wires `verify_api_token` into the dependency list so an invalid or missing token now yields a `401` as intended.

2. **Unsigned session cookie generation**  
   `app/utils/session_manager.py` signs session identifiers with HMAC and Base64-URL encodes the signature. The module forgot to import `base64`, so any attempt to create a session would raise a `NameError`, preventing logins. Adding the import restores the signing flow.

## Additional Observations

* The CVSS calculator and vulnerability import/export flows include comprehensive validation, but very large XML uploads are processed entirely in memory. Consider streaming parsing or imposing file-size limits if this becomes a concern.
* Rate limiting currently stores counters in-process. In a multi-worker deployment, move the limiter state into Redis or another shared backend to avoid bypasses.

## Test Coverage

`pytest` currently exercises the authentication, token, and vulnerability routers. Once the fixes above are in place the suite continues to pass (`pytest` run in CI is recommended for confirmation).
